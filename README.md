# Hello and welcome to my repo!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App*](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Portfolio

This project is a public mirror that reflects my true self: academics, skillset, career history and other aspects of life!

I have always wanted to carry something that would reflect me without even talking about it. This project, is that special `something`!!!

I'm trying my best to transfer all that's on my mind through the website.

## The COVID-19 pandemic: A message to mankind

They say mankind for a reason: human - a kind living being. It's my sincere request to each one of you to try and stay home as much as possible and explore yourself to make the full best use of your skills. Always remember that we can always do something or the other to save one another.

Try planting a sapling, or learning a new language, or organise online tutions for those younger to you (this way you're transfering your knowledge and also utilizing the best of your time), or learn new artforms, or maybe try and involve yourself with some interesting startup ideas to battle a real-time problem, or learn your heart out and implement your knowledge somewhere. There's a looooot to do, right? ;)

## Contact Me

I know that most of you would be a lot better maybe in the same field, or elsewhere. Let's carry the chain forward of enlightening each other or even support each other in times of a crisis.
